This is a solution to a question.

Write an immutable function that merges the following inputs into a single list. (Feel free to use the space below or submit a link to your work.)

Inputs
- Original list of strings
- List of strings to be added
- List of strings to be removed

Return
- List shall only contain unique values
- List shall be ordered as follows
--- Most character count to least character count
--- In the event of a tie, reverse alphabetical

Other Notes
- You can use any programming language you like
- The function you submit shall be runnable

For example:

Original List = ['one', 'two', 'three',]
Add List = ['one', 'two', 'five', 'six]
Delete List = ['two', 'five']
Result List = ['three', 'six', 'one']
